  Session fixation

description: |
  ### Impact

  The use of `Plug.Session` in `Pow.Plug.Session` is susceptible to session
  fixation attacks if a persistent session store is used for `Plug.Session`,
  such as Redis or a database. Cookie store, which is used in most Phoenix
  apps, doesn't have this vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds

  Call `Plug.Conn.configure_session(conn, renew: true)` periodically and after
  privilege change. A custom authorization plug can be written where the
  `create/3` method should return the conn only after
  `Plug.Conn.configure_session/2` have been called on it.
