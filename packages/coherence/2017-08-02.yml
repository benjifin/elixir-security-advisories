  Permissive parameters and privilege escalation

description: |
  The Coherence library has "Mass Assignment"-like vulnerabilities. In particular, "registration"
  endpoints (like creating, editing, updating), allow users to update any coherence_fields. This
  means that, among other issues, users can automatically confirm their accounts by sending the
  confirmed_at parameter with their registration request. Further, the library design and
  documentation encourages insecure functionality by default.

  For example, the "store" demo allows registering users to add themselves as admin:

  - ">= 0.5.2"
